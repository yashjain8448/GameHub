🎮 GameHub
GameHub is a modular Java-based game launcher that brings together classic games—Chess, TicTacToe, and Snake & Ladder—built with solid object-oriented design principles and implemented using core design patterns like Singleton, Factory, and Strategy.

🧠 About the Project
GameHub serves as a unified framework to launch multiple self-contained games through a clean CLI-based interface. The codebase demonstrates strong software design fundamentals including:

✅ Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism

✅ Separation of Concerns

✅ Interface-Based Programming

✅ Use of key Design Patterns:

🧩 Singleton – For centralized game manager and shared resources

🏭 Factory – For creating game instances dynamically

🎯 Strategy – For plug-and-play game logic like bot moves

🎮 Included Games
Game	Description
♟️ Chess:	Classic 2-player turn-based Chess game with full rules, validation, and win-checking.
❌⭕ TicTacToe: Supports both multi-player and Player vs Bot modes using Strategy pattern
🐍 Snake & Ladder	Supports multiple players, and simultaneous multiple game sessions

🔧 Tech Stack
Java (Core + OOP)

Java Collections Framework

Design Patterns: Singleton, Factory, Strategy

CLI / Console UI (easily extendable to GUI in future)

Modular project structure following clean code and LLD principles

🚀 Features
🧩 Extensible architecture – Easily add new games or plug in alternate strategies

👥 Flexible player modes – Human vs Human, Human vs Bot

🎲 Realistic game logic – Full rule implementation for each game

🔁 Multiple Game Instances – Especially in Snake & Ladder

✅ Testable components – Designed with separation of logic and interface

🛠 Future Enhancements
🎨 Add GUI using JavaFX or Swing
